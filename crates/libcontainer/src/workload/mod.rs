// Here is an explanation about the complexity below regarding to
// CloneBoxExecutor and Executor traits. This is one of the places rust actually
// makes our life harder. The usecase for the executor is to allow users of
// `libcontainer` to pass in a closure like function where the actual execution
// of the container workload can be defined by user. To maximize the flexibility
// for the users, we use trait object to allow users to pass in a closure like
// objects, so the function can container any number of variables through the
// structure. This is similar to the Fn family of traits that rust std lib has.
// However, our usecase has a little bit more complexity than the Fn family of
// traits. We require the struct implementing this Executor traits to be
// cloneable, so we can pass the struct across fork/clone process boundary with
// memory safety. We can't make the Executor trait to require Clone trait
// because doing so will make the Executor trait not object safe. Part of the
// reason is that without the CloneBoxExecutor trait, the default clone
// implementation for Box<dyn trait> will first unwrap the box. However, the
// `dyn trait` inside the box doesn't have a size, which violates the object
// safety requirement for a trait. To work around this, we implement our own
// CloneBoxExecutor trait, which is object safe.
//
// Note to future maintainers: if you find a better way to do this or Rust
// introduced some new magical feature to simplify this logic, please consider
// to refactor this part.
