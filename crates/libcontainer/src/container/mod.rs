//! Container management
/// This crate is responsible for the creation of containers. It provides a builder that can
/// be used to configure and create containers. We distinguish between an init container for which
/// namespaces and cgroups will be created (usually) and a tenant container process that will move
/// into the existing namespaces and cgroups of the initial container process (e.g. used to implement
/// the exec command).
