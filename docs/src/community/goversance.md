# Code of Conduct

Youki follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

# Maintainership

Youki is governed by Maintainers who are elected from active contributors.
Youki will keep the [vendor-neutrality](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).
Maintainers are [here](./maintainer.md).

## Roles

Maintainers are consist of the following roles:

- Committer (Full maintainership)
    Committers have full write accesses to repos.
    Committersâ€™ commits should still be made via GitHub pull requests (except for urgent security fixes), and should not be pushed directly.

## Addition and promotion of Maintainers

A contributor who have made significant contributions in quality and in quantity can be also directly invited as a Committer.
A proposal to add or promote a Maintainer must be approved by 2/3 of the Committers who vote within 7 days.
Voting needs 2 approvals at least. The proposer can vote too. Votes from the same company will be counted as one vote.
A proposal should happen as a GitHub pull request to the Maintainer list above. It is highly suggested to reach out to the Committers before submitting a pull request to check the will of the Committers.

## Removal and demotion of Maintainers

A Maintainer who do not show significant activities for 12 months, or, who have been violating the Code of Conduct, may be demoted or removed from the project.

A proposal to demote or remove a Maintainer must be approved by 2/3 of the Committers (excluding the person in question) who vote within 14 days.
Voting needs 2 approvals at least. The proposer can vote too. Votes from the same company will be counted as one vote.

A proposal may happen as a GitHub pull request, or, as a private discussion in the case of removal of a harmful Maintainer.
It is highly suggested to reach out to the Committers before submitting a pull request to check the will of the Committers.
