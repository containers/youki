youki is an implementation of [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) in Rust, referring to [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc).

# About the name

youki is pronounced as /joʊki/ or yoh-key.
youki is named after a Japanese word 'youki', which means 'a container'. In Japanese language, youki also means 'cheerful', 'merry', or 'hilarious'.

# Motivation

Here is why I am rewriting a new container runtime in Rust.

- Rust is one of the best languages to implement oci-runtime. Many container tools are written in Go. It's all very nice products. However, the container runtime requires the use of system calls, which requires a bit of special handling when implemented in Go. This is too tricky(e.g. _namespaces(7)_, _fork(2)_); with Rust, it's not that tricky and you can use system calls. Also, unlike C, Rust provides the benefit of memory management. Rust is not yet a major player in the container field, and Rust has the potential to contribute more to this field. I hope to be one of the examples of how Rust can be used in this field.
- youki has the potential to be faster and use less memory than runc. This means that it can work in environments with tight memory usage. I don't have any benchmarks, etc., as it is not yet fully operational, but I expect that it will probably perform better when implemented in Rust. In fact, [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun#performance), a container runtime implemented in C, is quite high performance. For example, it may be possible to experiment with asynchronous processing using async/await in some parts.
- The development of [railcar](https://github.com/oracle/railcar) has been suspended. This project was very nice but is no longer being developed. This project is inspired by it.
- I have fun implementing this. In fact, this may be the most important.

# Status of youki

youki is not at the practical stage yet. However, it is getting closer to practical use, running with docker and passing all the default tests provided by [opencontainers/runtime-tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools).

# Design and implementation of youki
![sequence diagram of youki](docs/.drawio.svg)

More details are in the works [#14](https://github.com/containers/youki/issues/14)

# Getting Started

Local build is only supported on linux.
For other platforms, please use [Vagrantfile](#setting-up-vagrant) that we prepared.

## Requires

- Rust(See [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- Docker(See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))

## Dependencies

### Debian, Ubuntu and related distributions

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install   \
      pkg-config         \
      libsystemd-dev     \
      libdbus-glib-1-dev \
      build-essential    \
      libelf-dev
```

### Fedora, Centos, RHEL and related distributions

```sh
$ sudo dnf install   \
      pkg-config     \
      systemd-devel  \
      dbus-devel     \
      elfutils-libelf-devel \
```

## Build

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git
$ cd youki
$ ./build.sh
$ ./youki -h # you can get information about youki command
```

## Tutorial

Let's try to run a container that executes `sleep 30` with youki. This tutorial may need root permission.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git
$ cd youki
$ ./build.sh

$ mkdir -p tutorial/rootfs
$ cd tutorial
# use docker to export busybox into the rootfs directory
$ docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -
```

Then, we need to prepare a configuration file. This file contains metadata and specs for a container, such as the process to run, environment variables to inject, sandboxing features to use, etc.

```sh
$ ../youki spec  # will generate a spec file named config.json
```

We can edit the `config.json` to add customized behaviors for container. Here, we modify the `process` field to run `sleep 30`.

```json
  "process": {
    ...
    "args": [
      "sleep", "30"
    ],

  ...
  }
```

Then we can explore the lifecycle of a container:
```sh
$ sudo ./youki create -b tutorial tutorial_container   # create a container with name `tutorial_container`
$ sudo ./youki state tutorial_container                # you can see the state the container is `created`
$ sudo ./youki start tutorial_container                # start the container
$ sudo ./youki list                                    # will show the list of containers, the container is `running`
$ sudo ./youki delete tutorial_container               # delete the container
```

Change the command to be executed in `config.json` and try something other than `sleep 30`.

## Usage

Starting the docker daemon.

```
$ dockerd --experimental --add-runtime="youki=$(pwd)/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/youki"
```

In case you get an error like :

```
failed to start daemon: pid file found, ensure docker is not running or delete /var/run/docker.pid
```

That means your normal Docker daemon is running, and it needs to be stopped. For that, open a new shell in same directory and run :

```
$ systemctl stop docker # might need root permission
```

Now in the same shell run the first command, which should start the docker daemon.

You can use youki in a different terminal to start the container.

```
$ docker run -it --rm --runtime youki busybox
```

Afterwards, you can close the docker daemon process in other the other terminal. To restart normal docker daemon (if you had stopped it before), run :

```
$ systemctl start docker # might need root permission
```

### Integration test

Go and node-tap are required to run integration test. See the [opencontainers/runtime-tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) README for details.

```
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ./integration_test.sh
# run specific test_cases with pattern
$ ./integration_test.sh linux_*
```

### Setting up Vagrant

You can try youki on platforms other than linux by using the Vagrantfile we have prepared.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git
$ cd youki
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

# in virtual machine
$ cd youki
$ ./build.sh
```
